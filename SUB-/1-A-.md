## **Topic 9: Practical Installation (NVM & Node)**

This section moves from theory to execution, demonstrating the terminal commands required to finalize the development environment. It emphasizes the importance of utilizing GitHub and command-line interfaces (CLI) for professional setups.

| Timestamp | Subtopic | Key Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **00:18:48** | NVM Source & Script | **Rationale:** Ensuring the user gets the official, most secure version of the manager.<br>

<br>

<br>**Implementation:** Locate NVM on GitHub and copy the **curl** command to automate the installation script in the terminal. |
| **00:19:10** | Node Selection | **Rationale:** To ensure the user has the correct environment for React Native/TypeScript.<br>

<br>

<br>**Implementation:** Verify NVM is active by listing versions and installing the **LTS** version of Node. |

---

## **Topic 10: Global TypeScript Implementation**

The final step of the setup involves using the newly installed Node environment to pull TypeScript into the system globally, allowing for universal access to the compiler.

| Timestamp | Subtopic | Key Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **00:19:27** | NPM Utility | **Rationale:** Node comes bundled with the **Node Package Manager** (npm).<br>

<br>

<br>**Implementation:** Use `npm` to handle the heavy lifting of downloading and configuring TypeScript. |
| **00:19:33** | Global vs. Local | **Rationale:** To ensure the `tsc` command is available system-wide.<br>

<br>

<br>**Implementation:** Use the `-g` flag during installation to install TypeScript as a global utility. |

## **Terminology & Vocabulary Improvement**

| Word/Phrase | Context | For Beginners (Simpler) | For Intermediate (Technical) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **"Curl Command"** | Installation | A shortcut to download/install files via text. | A CLI tool for transferring data with URL syntax. |
| **"Global"** | Scope | Available everywhere on your computer. | Persistence in the system’s environment variables/PATH. |
| **"Node Package Manager"** | Dependency | A library store for JavaScript tools. | The standard registry and CLI for JS modules. |
| **"TSC"** | Compiler | The tool that checks and converts TS code. | The TypeScript Compiler binary. |

---

## **Transcript Error Detection & Corrections**

This section highlights potential phonetic misinterpretations by the AI transcription service or minor verbal slips.

| Timestamp | Original Text (SRT) | Likely Intended Word/Action | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **00:19:40** | `mpxtsc` | `npx tsc` | The transcript combined the runner `npx` with the command `tsc` into a single nonsense word. |
| **00:18:58** | `your terminal.` | `the terminal.` | Stylistic; "The terminal" is more standard, though "Your" is acceptable in tutorial contexts. |
| **00:19:36** | `install-g` | `install -g` | The transcript lacks the necessary space between the command and the flag, which would cause a syntax error if copied literally. |

## **Code Snippets & Analogies**

**[00:19:26] - The "Toolbox" Metaphor**
The instructor treats **Node** as the toolbox and **NPM** as the person who goes to the store to buy the tools.

* **Deconstruction:** You can’t have the tool (TypeScript) until you have the runner (NPM) to go fetch it. Once Node is on your machine, NPM is automatically hired to manage all your future coding packages.

**[00:19:33] - Establishing the Compiler**
The foundational commands to move from a raw computer to a TypeScript-ready machine:

```bash
# Step 1: Install the language globally
npm install -g typescript

# Step 2: Verify the bridge is working
npx tsc --version

```
